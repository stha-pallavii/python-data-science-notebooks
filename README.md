# Python Data Science Notebooks

## Overview
This repository contains Python notebooks developed while learning Data Science and Machine Learning using Google Colab. The notebooks cover various statistical and machine learning concepts, implemented in Python using popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

## Contents
The repository includes the following Jupyter notebooks:

1. **ANOVA Analysis** (`anova.ipynb`)
   - Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for hypothesis testing.
   - Implementation of one-way and two-way ANOVA.
   - Use cases and interpretation of results.

2. **Correlation Analysis** (`correlation.ipynb`)
   - Understanding correlation between variables.
   - Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlation coefficients.
   - Visualization using heatmaps.

3. **Neural Network - Iris Dataset** (`neural_network_iris_dataset.ipynb`)
   - Building a neural network to classify the Iris dataset.
   - Implementation using TensorFlow/Keras.
   - Training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

4. **Neural Network - Wine Dataset** (`neural_network_wine_dataset.ipynb`)
   - Classification of wine samples using a neural network.
   - Data preprocessing and model training.
   - Model performance evaluation.

5. **One-Way ANOVA** (`one_way_anova.ipynb`)
   - Implementation of one-way ANOVA.
   - Practical examples in Python.
   - Interpretation of statistical results.

6. **Time Series Regression** (`time_series_regression.ipynb`)
   - Building regression models for time series data.
   - Forecasting and trend analysis.
   - Feature engineering for time series models.

## Requirements
